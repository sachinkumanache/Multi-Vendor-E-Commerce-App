# SampurnaBazaar – Multi-Vendor E-Commerce App

## Introduction
SampurnaBazaar is a fully functional e-commerce web application designed for both vendors and customers. It allows vendors to manage product listings and customers to browse, filter, and purchase products. This project simulates the end-to-end shopping experience from signup/login to checkout. Built with a clean UI and interactive features, the application demonstrates key front-end development concepts and integrates Firebase Realtime Database for backend services. User authentication and session management are handled using local storage.
